                    online service. You should read these conditions carefully to understand how these services work and your rights and duties under them.

                    b. If any of your accounts is a joint account, these conditions apply to all of you together and any of you separately. If more than one of you

                <p>
                    e. Our online sites are secure. Disconnection from the Internet or leaving these sites will not automatically log you off. You must always use
                    the log-off facility when you are finished and never leave your machine unattended while you are logged in. As a security measure, if you have
                    not used the sites for more than a specified period of time, we will ask you to log in again.
                </p>

                <h3>3. WHAT RULES APPLY TO SECURITY?</h3>
                <p>
                    a. As part of the registration for our online service, you must provide us with identity details before we allow you to use the services for the

                    our online service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e. You must not write down, store (whether encrypted or otherwise) on your computer, or let anyone else know your password, identity details, or
                    additional security details, and the fact that they are for use with your accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    f. If you think someone else knows your password or any of your additional security details or has used any of them to use our online service,

                    <li>For your additional security details, phone us immediately to change them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    g. We may give the police or any prosecuting authority any information they need if we think it will help them find out if someone else is using
                    your username, password, or any of your additional security details.
                </p>

                    b. Unless you are a victim of fraud, you are responsible for all instructions and other information sent using your username, password, or
                    additional security details.
                </p>

                <h3>5. HOW WE CAN CHANGE THESE CONDITIONS</h3>
